# Flutter ToDo App

A to-do app built with Flutter. A feature-rich to-do list mobile app using Flutter, incorporating a calendar view and a Pomodoro timer for enhanced productivity. I initiated the vibrant design and led the UI/UX development to create an intuitive user experience. Used Firebase for the back-end and authentication system. This included implementing email/password login, registration, and a password reset feature, ensuring a secure and seamless user experience.
